# Exercise Jokes Of The Day
In this exercise, you develop a angular application to show randomly a Joke from the Joke-Api: https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/random_joke

# The exercise itself.
You start this exercise by creating a new Angular App.
Use two components (JokeList en Joke) in a Joke Module.
This module should also contain a Joke model class and Joke data service.
Use Angular Material for the look and feel of the webpage (components). Create a module for the Material material.

A joke has a setup (mostly a question) and an punchline (the answer).

Functionality:
- clicking on a button gets a random Joke from the Joke api and shows the setup and the punchline.
- you can click as many times as you want on the 'Random Joke' button. All received jokes are shown.
- each joke has a bin (in a button), clicking on this button removes the joke from the list of jokes.
